## Description:
This is a single front page Daily planner using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make the functions work. The app displays ther current day, month and year so the user knows the exact date. The app will allow you to type in a given field corresponding to a certain hour (9 o'clock to 17 o'clock or 9am-5pm) in the day, and with the push of the button on the right you can save that information. Meaning you can reload the page and that data will be saved for that specific hour. For example in the field labelled 12:00 and typing lunch and clicking save will save that typed text into the field.
